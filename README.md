# MinimalFFT.jl

This is an implementation of the AbstractFFTs.jl interface in Julia.  All complex
tests in the AbstractFFTs testbench pass; the real tests are not fully supported
in this version.

This code has not been thoroughly tested and is mainly intended to better understand the AbsteactFFTs package.
